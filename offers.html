            <h1>MANIWAYA TRAVEL SPOTS: HIDDEN GEM IN MARINDUQUE</h1>
            <p class="desc">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Maniwaya Island is a small,palm-fringed island of the coast of Marinduque that made its mark as an ideal weekend getaway of urbanites. It's a tropical cliche, where you can bask in a white sand while sipping fruitshake or halo-halo or while reading your favorite book perhaps.Maniwaya is an island paradise whose beauty comes from its simplicity. For the longest time, there were no resorts on the island, just a few families living on the island sharing their homes’ simple facilities with locals who sometimes “come over” for a leisurely swim. Local Marinduqueños, particularly residents of Sta. Cruz, would just rent a boat to get to Maniwaya, stay there to swim and frolic under the sun for the day, and head back to the main island before sunset. There were no places to stay. But then, by word of mouth, more and more people got to know about Maniwaya, and it was inevitable for small resorts to rise on the island to provide what the visitors needed. </p>
